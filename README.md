###  About Me  

I’m a **Senior Technical Support Manager** with a strong foundation in **software engineering** and a growing specialization in **AI-driven support systems**.  
With hands-on experience across **cloud, observability, and DevOps**, I focus on leveraging **AI Agents**, **LLMs**, and **automation frameworks** to transform support operations into intelligent, proactive ecosystems.  

Over the past few years, I’ve led high-performing global support teams, optimized cloud spend, and built data-driven workflows that blend **engineering discipline with AI innovation**.

### 🧠 Current Focus  

-  **Agentic AI** — designing multi-layered cognitive agents that can perceive, remember, and act  
-  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — context-aware assistants with long-term memory  
-  **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — enabling persistent context and tool standardization for AI agents  
-  **Transformer Architecture** — embeddings, attention, and fine-tuning fundamentals  
-  **Cloud Automation** — AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, and Observability Stack

###  Featured Projects  

####  [Perfect-System-Prompt](https://github.com/nzalpha/Perfect-System-Prompt)
A framework for designing **system prompts** that optimize reasoning quality and explainability in LLMs.  
Focuses on structured step-by-step reasoning, CoT (Chain-of-Thought), and safe tool execution.

####  [My_MCP](https://github.com/nzalpha/My_MCP)
Explores the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — allowing AI agents to persist context, share tools, and coordinate multi-step actions.  
Integrates memory and state management for more autonomous agent behavior.

####  [Text-Style-Transformer](https://github.com/nzalpha/Text-Style-Transformer)
A minimal **Transformer model** built in Python to understand embeddings, tokenization, and attention mechanisms.  
Designed as a learning experiment to grasp the inner workings of modern LLMs.

####  [PaneMate](https://github.com/nzalpha/PaneMate)
Browser-based AI companion prototype for contextual UI generation, DOM parsing, and reasoning-based task execution.

####  [Savings-Challenge](https://github.com/nzalpha/Savings-Challenge)
Gamified financial tracker built using Gemini 2.5

####  [Helm & SmartApp Repositories](https://github.com/nzalpha?tab=repositories)
Set of **DevOps automation projects** using Helm, Groovy, and Java for scalable microservice deployments.  
Includes shared service libraries and CI/CD enhancements.

### AI-in-Support Project Highlight  

#### AI-Powered Support Assistant
An experimental prototype combining **LLM reasoning + Support workflows**.  
The assistant retrieves contextual knowledge, analyzes issue patterns, and recommends next steps for engineers.

**Core Design**
- 🧠 *Cognitive Pipeline:* Perceive → Remember → Decide → Act  
- 🔍 *Retrieval Layer:* Vector-based context lookup via LangChain  
- 🔗 *Integration:* MCP for multi-turn state persistence  
- 🧩 *Tool Use:* API-level access to logs, scripts, and case data  
- ⚡ *Outcome:* Reduced triage time and improved root-cause accuracy

### Professional Summary  

With a background in **software engineering** and **technical support leadership**, I’ve helped global enterprises modernize their support operations by merging **AI reasoning**, **cloud automation**, and **data-driven decision-making**.  
Currently, I’m exploring how **agentic architectures** and **retrieval-augmented intelligence** can empower support teams to work smarter, not harder.
